# 🐠 Clownfish

Clownfish is a conservative OpenClaw maintainer tool for one-cluster issue and PR cleanup.

It takes a curated GitHub issue/PR cluster, asks a Codex worker to classify the items, and applies only narrow, auditable cleanup actions when the evidence is strong. This compliments the pre-pass work on [clawsweeper](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper) and act as the second-pass intent based cluster resolution.

Allowed automated close reasons:

- duplicate of a clear canonical thread
- superseded by a clear canonical thread
- fixed by a specific candidate fix

Manual backlog-cleanup jobs may also use
[\`instructions/low-signal-prs.md\`](instructions/low-signal-prs.md) for
drive-by PRs that are clearly blank-template, docs-only discoverability churn,
test-only coverage spam, refactor-only noise, third-party capabilities that
belong on ClawHub, risky unapproved infra, or dirty branches. This policy is
opt-in per job and should return \`needs_human\` for plausible bug fixes or
anything with active maintainer signal.

Everything else stays open or is escalated for maintainer review.

Security-sensitive reports are deliberately out of scope. Clownfish
routes those refs to central OpenClaw security handling and keeps processing
unrelated ordinary bugs, provider gaps, and duplicate cleanup in the same
cluster. It follows OpenClaw \`SECURITY.md\`: trusted-operator exec behavior,
provider gaps, feature gaps, and hardening-only parity drift are not treated as
vulnerabilities unless there is a real trust-boundary bypass.

## Status

Clownfish is intentionally smaller than ClawSweeper. ClawSweeper scans the whole OpenClaw backlog on a cadence; Clownfish handles targeted clusters that were already grouped by a human, gitcrawl, or another dedupe tool.

Cluster discovery currently comes from [openclaw/gitcrawl](https://github.com/openclaw/gitcrawl).

The default workflow is proposal-first. It does not comment or close unless a job is explicitly promoted and the deterministic applicator confirms live GitHub state has not changed.

## How It Works

For a maintainer-facing architecture map of the automation lanes, see
[\`docs/INTERNAL_FEATURES.md\`](docs/INTERNAL_FEATURES.md).

For the ClawSweeper feedback loop that updates existing generated PRs, see
[\`docs/auto-update-prs.md\`](docs/auto-update-prs.md).

That loop is marker-driven. ClawSweeper comments use hidden
\`clawsweeper-verdict:*\` markers, and only actionable PR feedback includes
\`clawsweeper-action:fix-required\`. Clownfish skips stale head SHAs and caps
automatic repairs at five per PR and one per PR head SHA.

Maintainers can opt an existing Clownfish PR into the bounded merge loop with
\`/clownfish automerge\`. That adds \`clownfish:automerge\`, dispatches
ClawSweeper for the current head, lets Clownfish repair trusted
\`needs-changes\` findings for up to five rounds, and merges only after a trusted
pass verdict for the exact current head plus green checks, clean mergeability,
and explicit \`CLOWNFISH_ALLOW_MERGE=1\` and \`CLOWNFISH_ALLOW_AUTOMERGE=1\`
gates.

ClawSweeper commit findings have a separate intake lane. A
\`clawsweeper_commit_finding\` dispatch fetches the latest markdown commit report,
writes an audit record under \`results/commit-findings/\`, and only sends the
finding into the PR executor when the issue is narrow, non-security, and still
worth repairing on latest \`main\`.

Each cluster job:

1. Starts from one markdown job file under \`jobs/\`.
2. Hydrates the listed issue/PR refs and first-hop linked refs.
3. Builds a cluster plan and fix artifact for autonomous jobs.
4. Runs Codex with repo-local policy prompts and JSON output schema in a read-only sandbox.
5. Writes structured run artifacts under \`.projectclownfish/runs/\`.
6. Reviews the worker artifact with deterministic safety checks.
7. Executes credited fix artifacts through \`scripts/execute-fix-artifact.mjs\` when the fix gate is open: repair a maintainer-editable contributor branch first, otherwise raise a narrow replacement PR, add non-bot source PR authors as replacement co-authors, and close the uneditable source PR after the replacement push succeeds.
8. Applies guarded close/comment and explicit merge actions through \`scripts/apply-result.mjs\`.
9. Publishes a sanitized result ledger back to this repo under \`results/\`, \`jobs/openclaw/closed/\`, \`apply-report.json\`, and this README dashboard.

Codex does not receive a GitHub token during classification. The runner preflights GitHub state before model execution, then Codex receives those artifacts and returns JSON only. When a reviewed fix artifact is executed, Codex gets a temporary target checkout without GitHub credentials; the deterministic executor owns commit, push, PR creation, and source-PR closeout using \`CLOWNFISH_GH_TOKEN\`. Commit author metadata defaults to \`projectclownfish\` and can be overridden with \`CLOWNFISH_GIT_USER_NAME\` and \`CLOWNFISH_GIT_USER_EMAIL\`; this is separate from the GitHub token used to push. The applicator re-fetches the target item, checks \`updated_at\`, blocks unsafe closeouts, writes idempotent close comments, closes supported duplicate/superseded/fixed-by-candidate actions, and can squash-merge explicitly allowed clean PR actions.

Merge is deliberately harder than closeout. A merge action must include \`merge_preflight\` proving security clearance, resolved human comments, resolved review-bot findings, a passed Codex \`/review\`, addressed review findings, and clean validation commands. The fix executor runs an agentic edit/review loop before it writes a fix PR: edit, validate, Codex \`/review\`, address findings, revalidate, and resolve PR review threads when permitted. The applicator also checks live unresolved GitHub review threads immediately before merge.

Replacement fix work uses a recoverable target branch named \`clownfish/<cluster-id>\`. The executor resumes that branch if it already exists and pushes checkpoint commits after agent edits and review-fix edits, adding \`Co-authored-by\` trailers for non-bot source PR authors when a contributor PR is replaced. It then opens or updates the PR only after validation and Codex \`/review\` pass. If \`/review\` still blocks the merge after retries, the run writes a blocked fix report and leaves the checkpoint branch recoverable instead of losing the patch.

Runs for the same job path and mode are queued instead of running concurrently. The workflow uses Node 24, \`blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404\` for cluster planning/review, and \`blacksmith-16vcpu-ubuntu-2404\` for fix/apply execution. Fix execution prepares the target checkout with Corepack and the target \`pnpm\` package manager before validation; the execution job caches Codex, npm, Corepack, and the target pnpm store. Fix validation is pinned to OpenClaw's fast changed-lane posture by default: \`pnpm check:changed\` plus diff checks are the hard local gate, and target validation commands normalize to \`pnpm check:changed\` unless \`CLOWNFISH_TARGET_VALIDATION_MODE=strict\` or \`CLOWNFISH_STRICT_TARGET_VALIDATION=1\` is explicitly set. Unrelated flaky main CI, broad \`pnpm check\`, full tests, live, docker, and e2e lanes do not block narrow ProjectClownfish fixes by default.

Full worker prompts, Codex transcripts, and raw artifacts stay in GitHub Actions. The committed ledger keeps only the cluster summary, run URL, action counts, apply outcomes, closed targets, and needs-human entries.

## Modes

- \`plan\`: produces recommendations only.
- \`execute\`: can apply reviewed safe close and explicit clean merge actions from structured JSON.
- \`autonomous\`: adds live cluster preflight and fix-artifact generation. It may recommend and drive a canonical fix path; direct mutation still goes through the fix executor and applicator gates.
- \`route_security\`: quarantines true security-sensitive refs without poisoning unrelated cluster work.
- \`needs_human\`: only product-direction, trust-boundary, canonical-choice, merge-path, or contributor-credit decisions that remain unclear after the hydrated artifact and single-item review/check/decide pass.
- Automated reviewer feedback must be cleared during autonomous PR work. Greptile, Codex, Asile, CodeRabbit, Copilot, and similar bot comments must be addressed, proven non-actionable, or escalated before any merge or post-merge closeout recommendation.
- Merge preflight: no PR can merge until \`CLOWNFISH_ALLOW_MERGE=1\`, security issues are cleared, comments are resolved, Codex \`/review\` has passed, findings are addressed, and changed-surface validation is clean. With the merge gate closed, ProjectClownfish labels merge-ready targets for human review instead of merging.
- Repair ladder: make the useful contributor PR mergeable when its branch is maintainer-editable; otherwise replace draft, stale, unmergeable, uneditable, or unsafe branches with a narrow credited fix PR. When fix PR mode is enabled, "wait or replace" is already answered: replace, preserve credit, then supersede only the source PR that could not be safely updated.

## Maintainer Comment Commands

Clownfish can route maintainer comments from target repositories back into the
cloud repair workflow. It recognizes both command styles:

\`\`\`text
/clownfish status
@openclaw-clownfish status
\`\`\`

Do not use \`@clownfish\`; that is a separate GitHub user. The accepted mention is
\`@openclaw-clownfish\` or \`@openclaw-clownfish[bot]\`.

Only maintainers can trigger it. The router checks GitHub \`author_association\`
and accepts \`OWNER\`, \`MEMBER\`, and \`COLLABORATOR\` by default. Contributor and
unknown comments are ignored without a reply.

Supported commands:

\`\`\`text
/clownfish status
/clownfish fix ci
/clownfish address review
/clownfish rebase
/clownfish explain
/clownfish stop
@openclaw-clownfish fix ci
\`\`\`

\`status\` and \`explain\` post a short status reply. \`fix ci\`, \`address review\`,
and \`rebase\` dispatch the normal \`cluster-worker.yml\` repair path, but only for
existing Clownfish PRs identified by the \`clownfish\` label or \`clownfish/*\`
branch. \`stop\` labels the item for human review.

The router writes an idempotency marker into each reply and records processed
comments in \`results/comment-router.json\`. The scheduled workflow is dry by
default; set \`CLOWNFISH_COMMENT_ROUTER_EXECUTE=1\` to let scheduled runs post
replies and dispatch workers.

## GitHub Actions Setup

The workflow needs:

- Codex/OpenAI authentication for model execution
- a read-only GitHub token for worker inspection
- a separate write-scoped GitHub token for the deterministic applicator
- execution gates that default closed: set \`CLOWNFISH_ALLOW_EXECUTE=1\` and \`CLOWNFISH_ALLOW_FIX_PR=1\` only for an intentional execution window; otherwise execute/autonomous dispatches render plan-only output and skip mutation steps
- merge is separately gated by \`CLOWNFISH_ALLOW_MERGE\`; automerge additionally requires \`CLOWNFISH_ALLOW_AUTOMERGE\`; both default to \`0\`, and merge-ready PRs are labeled \`clownfish:human-review\` and \`clownfish:merge-ready\` for a maintainer to merge manually
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_CODEX_CLI_VERSION\` variable to pin and refresh the cached Codex CLI
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_MODEL\` override for dispatch scripts; default Codex model is \`gpt-5.5\`
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_MAX_LIVE_WORKERS\` variable for dispatch/requeue/self-heal worker fan-out; default is \`32\`
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_EXTERNAL_PREFLIGHT_CONCURRENCY\` variable for parallel read-only external merge validation inside each cluster worker; default is \`3\`. Guarded merge application remains sequential so concurrent preflights cannot race mutations against a moving base.
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_EXTERNAL_PREFLIGHT_HEARTBEAT_MS\` variable for progress output while buffered external preflight children run; default is \`60000\` ms. Each child logs its start, elapsed heartbeat, and finish without exposing captured command output or credentials.
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_MAX_ACTIVE_PRS_PER_AREA\` variable for replacement PR backpressure; default is \`50\` open Clownfish PRs per touched area, \`0\` disables the area cap, and common changelog/release-note files are ignored for this check
- ClawSweeper commit-finding repair PRs are labeled \`clownfish:commit-finding\`
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS\`, \`CLOWNFISH_FIX_CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS\`, and \`CLOWNFISH_FIX_STEP_TIMEOUT_MS\` variables; worker planning defaults to 30 minutes, while fix execution defaults to a 20 minute Codex budget inside a 40 minute executor step so timeout artifacts can be written
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_REBASE_ONLY_FIX_STEP_TIMEOUT_MS\` and \`CLOWNFISH_REBASE_ONLY_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MS\` variables; explicit \`rebase_only\` jobs default to 25 minutes with a five minute review cap, refresh current main before review to avoid reviewing a stale rebase, emit stage timing to the workflow log, and defer the Codex write preflight unless an actual rebase conflict needs a write worker. The review never mutates GitHub and may make only the minimum read-only \`gh\` query required by target-repo instructions.
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_CODEX_REVIEW_ATTEMPTS\` and \`CLOWNFISH_RESOLVE_REVIEW_THREADS\` variables for agentic merge-prep review loops
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_CLAWSWEEPER_MAX_REPAIRS_PER_PR\` and
  \`CLOWNFISH_CLAWSWEEPER_MAX_REPAIRS_PER_HEAD\` variables for trusted
  ClawSweeper review feedback; defaults are \`5\` automatic repair iterations per
  PR and \`1\` repair per PR head SHA. The per-PR cap is total across changing
  head SHAs and stops the automatic review/repair loop.
- optional \`CLOWNFISH_COMMENT_ROUTER_EXECUTE=1\` to let the scheduled comment
  router respond to maintainer-only \`/clownfish ...\` and
  \`@openclaw-clownfish ...\` commands. Without it, scheduled runs only write a
  dry report.

Keep exact secret names, token scopes, and execution-window procedures in private operations docs or repository settings notes. Do not put token values or live operational credentials in job files.
